# JC's Web Application

## Description

I developed this web app with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I've integrated the jQuery library into the app. It fetches from a Pokemon API and displays the Pokemon as buttons. The buttons can be clicked to trigger modal functions built into Bootstrap. The modals display the Pokemon images, names, types, and heights.
